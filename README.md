时间是什么呢？时间是一所无形的牢笼，我们是它的囚徒，被困在因果律中不停向前；
时间是小径分岔的花园，我们在无数选择中分化，又在无数选择中汇合；
又或者时间是一场幻梦，未来和过去在半梦半醒之间相遇，现在只是片刻的真实。<br>
What is time? Time is an intangible prison, and we are its prisoners, trapped in the law of causality, constantly moving forward;
Time is a garden where paths diverge, where we branch out with countless choices and converge again with countless others;
Or perhaps time is but an illusion, where the future and the past meet in the liminal space between dreaming and waking, with the present being just a moment of reality. <br>

旅人Gary从监狱中醒来，获得了操控时间循环的能力，在友人幻象的帮助下，收集一朵朵金黄的郁金香。

最后，他做了一场梦，在梦中他遇见了一只巨大的鸟...
鲜花落在墓碑，友人已然离去。
在这个真实的片刻，只剩下自我与自我的幻象。 <br>
Traveler Gary wakes up from prison and gains the ability to control time loops. With the help of his friend's illusion, he collects golden tulips one by one.
He knows he wants to see those people and present the flowers to them. On his journey, he encounters a little bird thief who steals flowers, 
a black cat that can travel through paintings but is still waiting for a good friend, and even climbs through layers of clouds to glimpse the mysterious Mother Moon.
In the end, he has a dream where he meets a giant bird...
Flowers fall on the tombstone, and friends have already departed.
In this real moment, only the self and the illusion of the self remain. <br>
